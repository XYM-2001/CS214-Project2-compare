When testing, we tried several cases including no arguments(error print to stderr), directory with no files(error), two identical files(JSD=0), two files completely different(JSD = 1), two empty files(JSD = 0), a regular file with a empty file(JSD = sqrt(2)), files contains only 1 word, only whitespaces(same as an empty file), directories within directories, different mount of files with different amount of words.
The output was correct in every situation listed above so that we have determined our program is correct.
